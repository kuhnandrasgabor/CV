# Interests

**Renaissance man**  
*\-an individual whose knowledge spans a significant number of subjects, known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems.*

## Creativity

At a young age, I used to pour my creativity into legos, which later spilled out into photography and 3D visualizations, then actual physical objects around me.

## Mechanics

I always liked building actual working machines, robots, various pulley-pneumatics-cogs based actuating contraptions.

## Electronics

My childhood hobby was building and racing pretty much anything that was remote-controlled and electric powered, this later manifested in me designing and prototyping an Arduino-Raspberry Pi based wireless home ventilation monitoring and control system.

## Design

I like coming up with various physical and decorative items, then making them, whether they are a simple sheetrock ceiling lamp, or an icosahedron shaped concrete bowl. The task is always to get the most utility along with an aesthetic form.

## Creation

I like working with my two hands and seeing my digital designs take shape in the real world. I am greatly interested in 3D printing, but I am nonetheless interested in most crafts like woodworking and concrete, from the scale of decor items all the way to actually building a house. 

## Technology

I love technology and am a futurist at heart. I’m immensely interested in the human race and its prospects regarding our planet, green tech, climate change, space colonization, AI, quantum computing and so on...
