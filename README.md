### But... why is my CV written in Markdown, on GitHub?

I created this repository for a few reasons:

I wanted to provide specific CVs for specific job applications, tailored to the job description and offer the HR person some freedom to choose the type they like to work with, both in English and Hungarian.
* To do
  that, I'd need a **_lot_** of different versions of my CV.
* I got tired of trying to keep my various CVs in sync.
* I wanted a simple, text-based format that I can version control, update and change should I want to.
* I also wanted to be able to link to dynamic pages or downloadable PDFs, and easily exclude potentially data-heavy content like images or videos from the CVs.

This approach is the result of that. It's not perfect, but it's mostly ok.
It allows me to have a **single source of truth** for my CVs, and generate them in a format that's easy to share and read,
and somewhat simply keep the content of the two languages in sync.

Meanwhile, GitHub automatically renders the Markdown files, so I can easily share the CVs with anyone, and they can view
them in a nice, readable and up-to-date format.
