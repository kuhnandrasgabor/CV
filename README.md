### But... why Markdown on GitHub?

* I got tired of trying to keep my various CVs in sync.
* I wanted a simple, text-based format that I can version control, update and change should I want to.
* I also wanted to be able to generate both English and Hungarian versions from the same source, and generate tailored
  CVs for specific job applications by including or excluding certain sections, or externally adding those.

This approach, thrown together over a weekend, is the result of that. It's not perfect, but it's mostly there.
It allows me to have a single source of truth for my CVs, and generate them in a format that's easy to share and read,
and somewhat simply keep the content of the two languages in sync.

Meanwhile, GitHub automatically renders the Markdown files, so I can easily share the CVs with anyone, and they can view
them in a nice, readable and up-to-date format.
