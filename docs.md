The CVs are stitched together from multiple Markdown files, each containing a section of the CV. 

You define the structure of it in the [cv_config.json](scripts/cv_config.json) file by defining the following:
* **language support:** the languages you want to support and their suffixes
* **profile name:** the name of the main body of a generated CV, such as "Programming-Oriented" or "Graphics-Oriented"
* **main profile body's content:** the sections of the CV where you can define content elements

A content-element has the following properties:
* `"file": "demo/included-file1"`
* **files:** relative path to the file that contains the content block we wish to use 
    * either a path to the file that will be copied into the body of the CV if no content array is defined
    * or the location and name of a sub-document that will be generated based on the content array 
* `"link": {
  "_en": "### [Link to linked-file1]",
  "_hu": "### [linked-file1 -re mutat√≥ link]"
  }`
* **links:** a dictionary, holding the text of the link button for each supported language, that is pointing to
    * either the file 
    * or the generated sub-document
    * the link is the first part of the Markdown text, so it can be used with Markdown formatting like hashtags, but needs to be in square brackets for the syntax to work properly 
      * (the link its*elf is calculated by the [combine.py](scripts/combine.py) script)
* `"content":[{"file": "demo/included-file3"},{"file": "demo/included-file4"}`
* **content:** an array of the content for the section used to
    * include multiple files
    * or build a subpage*
