## Waterfront House - Personal Project (2019)

* Designed and modeled a concept house in Sketchup, later refined and rendered photorealistically in Blender.
* Applied procedural materials and HDRI lighting for realistic exterior and interior scenes.
* Integrated custom foliage and architectural assets to produce a detailed, lifelike render of the house concept.
