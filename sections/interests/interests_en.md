# Interests

## Creation

Creating and altering things has grown to be a fundamental part of my life. Whether it's a piece of software, a 3D model, furniture, or a photo, I have enjoyed the process of creation and the satisfaction of seeing the results of my work since early childhood.

## Creativity and Design

A strong passion for creativity, from legos to VR to simulation and design, this passion fuels my interest in software development and design.

## Mechanics and Electronics

What started out as hobby R/C models has kept up with me throughout my life, as I have built (and repaired) various electronic devices. This hands-on experience of taking things apart, understanding how they work, and putting them back together enhances my understanding of hardware-software integration.

## Technology and Futurism

I am deeply interested in emerging technologies and their potential impacts on society, such as AI, quantum computing, and space exploration. This forward-thinking mindset gives me perspective when I approach my software development and data science endeavours.

## Nature, Elements, Exploration

Since as long as I can remember, I have always enjoyed water and am a certified scuba diver. For most of my adult life, I have been a rock climber and outdoor enthusiast. Lately I picked up paragliding, adding an additional element to my interests. In my life, I seem to gravitate towards activities that reward me with a sense of exploration and connection to the natural world, while demanding personal responsibility and self-reliance.
