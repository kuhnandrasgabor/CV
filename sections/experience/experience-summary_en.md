I'm a professional with over a decade of diverse experience spanning various fields, ranging from **machine learning** and **web development** through **3D visualizations** to professional **photography**.

I have experience in leadership roles in **smaller teams**, including CEO of a tech startup, where I led a
complex multiplayer **online game development** project, and later as CTO of a startup doing **AI powered industrial data management** and SaaS solutions for aviation MROs and other heavy industries.

I have some experience in business negotiation and project management, but am my *very best* at **creative design and problem-solving**, where I can make the most of my wide spanning technical background I gathered throughout my work and hobbies. I am a very firm believer in the pareto principle, and try to equip myself with knowledge among various fields, while relying on specialits in matters where I am not an expert of.
