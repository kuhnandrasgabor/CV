I Initially joined as a freelance developer, wound up acting as CTO, overseeing all development and architecture decisions.

I was tasked with the re-development of a data management software prototype and subsequent deployment as an SaaS solution designed for aerospace MRO's and heavy industry.

During my tenure I was collaborating on strategic planning, technical decision-making, and future company growth, including equity stake for my contributions.

A few bigger milestones iclude an SAP S4/HANA integration prototype, ElasticSearch analytics prototype, Azure storage management with media services video streaming prototype, and the project's core value add: development and implementation of visual search and OCR solutions.
