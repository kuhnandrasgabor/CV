The project was managed in **Azure DevOps** using a **CI/CD** pipeline implementation, hosted in Azure.
We decided on **.Net Core** with **Blazor Razor** pages, **MongoDB** for database and **MAUI** for Android and WebClient build targets.
The project was a complete rewrite of the existing software, with a focus on **modularity** and **scalability**, so we used 
a microservice architecture with a frontend server, core server, and various recognition module servers.
