I have over the years gathered experience across various industries from photography, and programming to real-estate renovation.

On the computer side of things I was part of a team tasked with building a multilanguage checklist app for iOs, and I had worked on a Magento based online furniture store mostly written in PHP.

On the visuals front, I worked on interactive, real-time 3D architectural visualization projects using Unreal Engine 4 and Blender for both personal and client projects. 

I did 3D modeling and animation work in Blender, and branding, advertising, logo and web design work in Adobe Creative Suite.

For personal projects and changing things up, I did some remodeling and renovation work, and also worked for quite some time as a freelance photographer just for fun and to keep my skills sharp.
