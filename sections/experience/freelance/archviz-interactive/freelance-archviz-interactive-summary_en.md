A contractor friend of mine approached me with an offer to help him with a family house he was building soon. We decided to see if prototyping a realistic interactive 3D walk around showcase for the project was worth it. 

I was provided some CAD drawings and a floorplan on which I modeled the house in Blender, designed some realistic PBR materials and textures, and set up a scene in Unreal Engine 4. The result was a realistic interactive 3D walk around showcase of the house, that you can still try out [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18HLLP1rOycEmTNhTGDjkPf6v8MJuqwSk/view?usp=sharing) or just watch another one of these projects [on youtube](https://youtu.be/XRm1u-OF0CA). I even built custom model generators for kitchen cabinets and a solar gain based 3D plant-growth model in Houdini, just for giggles.
