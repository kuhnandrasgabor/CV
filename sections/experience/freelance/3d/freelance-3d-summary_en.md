I had the opportunity to work on some 3D visualizations for interactive training material related to natural disasters.
I had to come up with ways to illustrate, then model and render various **natural disasters**, such as floods, earthquakes, wildfires and wildfires. 
To do this, I used **Blender's physics simulation** for **fluids**, and **smoke**, along with **rigidbody** **collisions**, and destruction. 
In order to meet tight deadlines, I had the **rendering** running on seven computers in the office **simultaneously** after baking the sims.
