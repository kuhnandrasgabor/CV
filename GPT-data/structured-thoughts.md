## Beliefs and Expectations

I am a firm believer in **meritocracy** and the power of hard work. I expect this to be the case in any company I work
for.

## Compensation Philosophy

- **Trade-offs:** Willing to trade immediate monetary reward for future growth opportunities like equity or
  profit-sharing.
- **Fair Compensation:** Expect to be compensated fairly for my work.
- **Negotiation:** Not afraid to negotiate for a fair salary.
- **Confidence:** Confident in my abilities to find the right fit; not desperate for a job.
    - Thoughts: _Truthfully, I do need money to survive, and I do have expenses, but I'm not going hungry. I've done
      pretty shitty work before like absolutely mindless construction work. I'm ok with that too. It gives me time to
      listen to podcasts and exercise. I literally built my friend's family house's foundation._

## Work-Life Balance

I am willing to come in early, stay late, and work weekends occasionally, but abuse of this flexibility is a
deal-breaker.

- **Health and Sanity:** Not willing to sacrifice health and sanity for someone else's bottom line.
- **Temporary Workload Increases:** Can empathize with situations requiring a temporary increase in workload, but this
  should be the exception, not the rule.

## Communication and Growth

- **Open Communication:** Comfortable giving praise and asking questions if something is unclear.
- **Feedback:** Comfortable receiving feedback and constructive criticism.
- **Learning Mindset:** Not afraid to admit when I'm wrong; always willing to learn from mistakes.
- **Teaching Others:** Eager to teach others what I know and learn new things.

## Ai tools and Automation

- **AI Tools:** I am comfortable using AI tools and automation to improve efficiency and productivity, I am also willing
  to learn new tools and technologies.
- **Automation:** I am very partial to automate-away problems I keep encountering.
- **AI Ethics:** I am concerned by the way others might think AI tools impact their work, and I am willing to help them
  understand the benefits and limitations of AI tools.

## Sports and Physical Activity

- **Importance of Physical Activity:** I believe that physical activity is essential for a healthy lifestyle and
  productivity.
- **Teams**: Even thought I'm a team player, I heavily dislike team sports. I prefer individual sports like running,
  swimming, and cycling.

## Health

- **Mental Health:** I believe that mental health is just as important as physical health, and I am willing to take
  steps to ensure my mental well-being, like meditation, therapy, and mindfulness.
- **Physical Health:** I believe that physical health is essential for a healthy lifestyle, and I am willing to take
  steps to ensure my physical well-being, like regular exercise, a balanced diet, and regular check-ups.
- **Sleep:** I believe that sleep is essential for a healthy lifestyle, and I am willing to take steps to ensure I get
  enough sleep, like maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and electronics before bed, and creating a
  comfortable sleep environment.
- **Diet:** I believe that diet is essential for a healthy lifestyle, and I am willing to take steps to ensure I eat a
  balanced diet, like cooking my own meals, avoiding processed foods, and eating plenty of fruits and vegetables.
- **Vices:** To be frank, I believe smoking is a litmus test for intelligence. I don't smoke, and I don't drink. What I
  do is have a bit of coffee addiction/snobbery going on. In fact, I have a Google survey I made to track my coffee
  statistics at
  some point that ended up as this gargantuan table filled with charts and graphs. I rarely drink more than three
  coffees a day though. I do love cola, but my rules are that I never buy it for home, and I only drink it when I'm out
  and about. I hate expending my willpower on useless calories.

## Hobbies and Interests

- **Reading:** I used to read a lot of sci-fi, especially during the MMORPG development days, but lately I've fallen out
  of reading.
- **Gaming:** I used to play a lot of games of varying types, still have Steam and GOG installed, and whenever something
  interesting comes along I usually try to set some time aside and give it a go, but realistically, gone are the days of
  8-hour gaming sessions and raiding in WoW. I do tend to pick up indie titles now and then, like Disco Elysium,
  Inscryption, Sunless Skies, and the like. I am a giant KSP fan, and I've been playing it since the early days. Played
  most of the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games, and I'm a big fan of the Witcher series, but I also like city builders
  like Cities: Skylines and optimization games like Shapez.io. In case you want to check me out, my steam ID is
  eyewitness4560.
- **Music**: I love music, and I listen to a lot of different genres, but I'm a big fan of DnB, Synthwave, and Trance
  from the 90s. I also like some rock, jazz, and classic hits from the 70s and 80s. To my chagrin, I've never picked up
  an instrument.
- **Cooking**: I love cooking, and I've been doing it for a long time. I'm not a professional chef, but I can make
  pretty much _any_ food taste good. I'm a big fan of spicy food, and I like to experiment with different cuisines. Most
  of my culinary knowledge comes from watching cooking shows, especially Good Eats with the absolute legend: Alton
  Brown. I always try to cook healthy and balanced meals, but I'm not afraid to indulge in some comfort food now and
  then.
- **Photography**: I love photography, and I've been taking pictures for a long time. I usually just do it for my own
  enjoyment, but I've done a couple of weddings and applied photography gigs. 20+ years of experience, and now I'm
  slowly getting into videography. My favorite subjects are landscapes, architecture, and abstract compositions. I'm a
  big fan of long exposure shots and black and white photography, but I also really like vibrant colors and high
  contrast, especially golden and orange contrasts with deep blues. I love converging lines and repeating patterns, and
  when I can frame things in a way that makes them look alien, or infinitely repeating minimalism. Last year I upgraded
  to an R6 Mark II after 13 years of using a 5D Mark II.
- **Traveling**: I love traveling, and I've been to a lot of places in and around Europe. I've been to Cuba and to
  Africa several times, but not really to Asia or the Americas. I've been to a lot of places in Europe, but I've never
  been to the UK, which is a bit of a shame. I really love the mountains in Austria and Switzerland, and I've been to
  the Alps several times. I've also been to the Canary Islands, which are beautiful, and I've been to the Mediterranean
  several times.
- **Environmentalism**: I am a big fan of environmentalism, and I try to do my part in reducing my carbon footprint. I
  recycle, compost, and try to buy local and organic produce whenever possible. I also try to reduce my water and
  electricity consumption, and I try to avoid single-use plastics. I'm a big fan of electric cars, in fact, I own a
  Tesla Model 3. I also try to support companies that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, and conversely I do
  not plan to work for companies that push billions of dollars into lobbying against environmental regulations and
  reasonable climate policies.
