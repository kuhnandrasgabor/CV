I have experience in leadership roles in **smaller teams**, including CEO of a tech startup, where I led a
complex multiplayer **online game development** project, and later as CTO of a startup doing **AI powered industrial data management** and SaaS solutions for aviation MROs and other heavy industries.

I have some experience in business negotiation and project management, but am my *very best* at **creative design and problem-solving**, where I can make the most of my wide spanning technical background I gathered throughout my work and hobbies. I am a very firm believer in the pareto principle, and try to equip myself with knowledge among various fields, while relying on specialits in matters where I am not an expert of.

Thanks to my english skills, I excel in multicultural environments.

Committed to **continuous learning and improvement**, with an eye for detail and a passion for technology and innovation, I try to use technology to improve all aspects of my personal and professional life, such as using AI tools when justified/appropriate.

## 2020 – Present: Data Science, Machine Learning, Full-Stack Developer & Acting CTO at Pzartech Ltd.


I Initially joined as a freelance developer, wound up acting as CTO, overseeing all development and architecture decisions.

I was tasked with the **re-development** of a **data management software** prototype and subsequent deployment as an **SaaS solution** designed for aerospace MRO's and heavy industry.

During my tenure I was collaborating on strategic planning, technical decision-making, and future company growth, including equity stake for my contributions.

A few bigger milestones iclude an **SAP S4/HANA** integration prototype, **ElasticSearch** analytics prototype, **Azure storage** management with media services **video streaming** prototype, and the project's core value add: development and implementation of **visual search and OCR** solutions.


* Full-stack web development on .Net Core, Blazor, Razor, MongoDB, MAUI
* ML/AI development with Python
* Image classifier and OCR system training and deployment
* CI/CD with Azure DevOps, Azure Portal
* Version control with Git through Azure DevOps

### Web based data management software

The project was managed in **Azure DevOps** using a **CI/CD** pipeline implementation, hosted in Azure.
We decided on **.Net Core** with **Blazor Razor** pages, **MongoDB** for database and **MAUI** for Android and WebClient build targets.
The project was a complete rewrite of the existing software, with a focus on **modularity** and **scalability**, so we used 
a microservice architecture with a frontend server, core server, and various recognition module servers.

* SaaS software structure and design consultation for ERP software
* Azure cloud resource deployment and management
* Azure DevOps project management, CI/CD
* .Net Blazor Razor pages based project with MAUI multiplatform build targets
  * Azure bucket storage integration and management
  * API connections between
    * frontend server
    * core server
    * various recognition module servers
  * Image and Character recognition development and integration
  * Responsive UI with MudBlazor (although I'm not really a front-end developer)
  * ElasticSearch based page and usage analytics prototype
  * Media storage and streaming prototype with Azure media services
  * SAP integration prototype for SAP HANA S/4 Product Master Data

#### Skills used/developed
  * C#, Python, HTML
  * .Net Core, Blazor, Razor, MongoDB, MAUI
  * Azure DevOps, Azure Portal, CI/CD
  * Version control with Git through Azure DevOps

### Machine learning and training

#### Image Classifier

I was tasked with improving the results and scope of the image classifier network we used for industrial part recognition.

#### OCR

Another task of mine was the prototyping of an OCR software solution, where we had to detect writing from stamped machine parts to hand-engraved dotmatrix serial numbers.

#### Skills used/developed
  * C# for the API, but mostly Python for training and inference
  * FastAi, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Jupyter notebooks and Paperspace Gradient
  * Flask, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy
  * Docker, Docker-Compose

## 2011 – Present: Freelance Professional (Photography, 3D Graphics, Webdesign, Architectural Visualization)


Worked on a multilanguage checklist app for iOS, a PHP Magento-based online store, interactive, real-time 3D architectural visualization projects, 3D modeling and animation, branding, advertising, logo and web design and as a freelance photographer.

#### *3D modelling and visual effects*

I had the opportunity to work on some 3D visualizations for interactive training material related to natural disasters.

#### Interactive Architectural Visualization

A contractor friend of mine approached me with an offer to help him with a family house he was building soon. We decided to see if prototyping a realistic **interactive 3D walk around showcase** for the project was worth it. 

I was provided some CAD drawings and a floorplan on which I modeled the house in **Blender**, designed some **realistic PBR materials and textures**, and set up a scene in Unreal Engine 4. The result was a realistic interactive 3D walk around showcase of the house, that you can still try out [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18HLLP1rOycEmTNhTGDjkPf6v8MJuqwSk/view?usp=sharing) or just watch another one of these projects [on youtube](https://youtu.be/XRm1u-OF0CA). I even built custom model generators for kitchen cabinets and a solar gain based 3D plant-growth model in **Houdini**, just for giggles.


* Real-time interactive demo software using Unreal Engine 4
* Hybrid lighting, using both real-time reflections and switchable dynamic lights, with pre-baked lightmaps
* Realistic PBR materials and textures
* Custom model generators for kitchen cabinets and a sunlight based 3D plant-growth model in Houdini

# Interests

## Creation

Creating and altering things has grown to be a fundamental part of my life. Whether it's a piece of software, a 3D model, furniture, or a photo, I have enjoyed the process of creation and the satisfaction of seeing the results of my work since early childhood.

## Creativity and Design

A strong passion for creativity, from legos to VR to simulation and design, this passion fuels my interest in software development and design.

## Mechanics and Electronics

What started out as hobby R/C models has kept up with me throughout my life, as I have built (and repaired) various electronic devices. This hands-on experience of taking things apart, understanding how they work, and putting them back together enhances my understanding of hardware-software integration.

## Technology and Futurism

I am deeply interested in emerging technologies and their potential impacts on society, such as AI, quantum computing, and space exploration. This forward-thinking mindset gives me perspective when I approach my software development and data science endeavours.

## Nature, Elements, Exploration

Since as long as I can remember, I have always enjoyed water and am a certified scuba diver. For most of my adult life, I have been a rock climber and outdoor enthusiast. Lately I picked up paragliding, adding an additional element to my interests. In my life, I seem to gravitate towards activities that reward me with a sense of exploration and connection to the natural world, while demanding personal responsibility and self-reliance.
